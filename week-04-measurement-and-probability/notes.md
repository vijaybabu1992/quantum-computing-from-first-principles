🔹 WEEK 4 — Measurement and Probability (Born Rule)

In Week 1, I learned that quantum computing is linear algebra.
In Week 2, I saw qubits as vectors.
In Week 3, I understood quantum gates as matrices.

This week, I finally understood where probability enters the picture.

Measurement.

💡 MEASUREMENT & PROBABILITY (IN SIMPLE TERMS)

Before measurement, a quantum state is just a vector.
After measurement, we observe a classical outcome.

The rule connecting the two is simple:

Probability = (amplitude)²

This is known as the Born Rule.

📘 WHAT I LEARNED THIS WEEK

• Measurement converts amplitudes into probabilities  
• Squaring amplitudes gives real, measurable outcomes  
• Measurement collapses the state to a basis vector  
• Quantum evolution is deterministic — measurement is not  

🧠 KEY INSIGHT FROM WEEK 4

Quantum uncertainty does not come from evolution.
It comes from measurement.

Before measurement:
• State evolves predictably using matrices

At measurement:
• Probability enters
• Information is lost

Seeing this separation removed a lot of confusion.

🛠️ HOW I PRACTICED

• Computed measurement probabilities using NumPy  
• Simulated repeated measurements  
• Verified frequency matches theoretical probability
