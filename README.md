# Quantum Computing from First Principles

Quantum computing is often presented as physics-heavy and inaccessible.
This repository documents my attempt to learn it slowly and correctly — starting from linear algebra.

The goal is not speed, but clarity.

## Why this repository?

Before diving into advanced physics or hardware, quantum computing can be understood as:
• Vectors representing states  
• Matrices representing operations  
• Probability emerging through measurement  

This repo focuses on building that intuition step by step.

## Learning Roadmap

### Week 1: Linear Algebra Foundations
• Why vectors and matrices are central to quantum computing  
• Probability amplitudes vs classical probabilities  

### Week 2: Qubits as Vectors
• Basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩  
• Superposition as linear combination  
• Normalization and probability  

### Week 3: Quantum Gates as Matrices
• Gates as linear transformations  
• Matrix × Vector operations  
• Why quantum gates are reversible  

(Upcoming)
• Measurement and probability  
• Multi-qubit systems  
• Entanglement (from a math-first view)

## Tools Used
• Python  
• NumPy  
• Jupyter Notebooks  

## How to Use This Repo
Each week contains:
• A short concept explanation (notes.md)
• One or more Jupyter notebooks
• Minimal math, maximum intuition

This repository reflects a learning-in-public journey and will evolve weekly.
