# Week 1: Linear Algebra Foundations

Quantum computing often looks complex because it is introduced through physics.
In reality, its mathematical foundation is linear algebra.

This week focuses on understanding why vectors, matrices, and probabilities are the core building blocks of quantum computing.

## Why Linear Algebra?

In classical computing:
• Information is stored as bits (0 or 1)
• Operations are logical (AND, OR, NOT)

In quantum computing:
• Information is stored as vectors
• Operations are matrix transformations
• Outcomes are probabilistic

Before measurement, everything happens in vector space.

## Vectors as Information

A vector is an ordered list of numbers.
In quantum computing, a vector represents the *state* of a system.

Example:
A state can be written as a column vector with numerical values.
These values are called probability amplitudes.

Important:
• Amplitudes are NOT probabilities
• Probabilities come from squaring amplitudes

## Probability Amplitudes vs Probabilities

Classical probability:
• Always positive
• Sum to 1

Quantum probability amplitudes:
• Can be positive, negative, or complex
• Squares of amplitudes sum to 1

This is why interference effects exist in quantum systems.

## Key Takeaway

Quantum computing is not magic.
It is linear algebra applied to information, with probability introduced at measurement.

Understanding vectors and matrices removes much of the mystery early on.
